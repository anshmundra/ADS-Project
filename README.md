## Overview
This project explores how to effectively implement and possibly improve upon existing models for digit classification in complex, real-world images. Our focus is on preprocessing data, building and comparing different CNN models, and experimenting with complex object detection frameworks like YOLO.

## Contents
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - This section deals with preparing the data for modeling. It includes cleaning, normalizing, augmenting, and splitting the dataset.
   
2. **Model 1 Building**
   - Here, we develop our first CNN model.
   
3. **Model 2 Building**
   - This section describes the development of the second CNN model.
   
4. **YOLO Implementation Attempt**
   - An exploratory section where we attempt to implement the YOLO model for object detection.
